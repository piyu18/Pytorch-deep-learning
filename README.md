# Pytorch for Deep Learning
## Deep Learning
Deep learning is a machine learning technique inspired by the human brain. In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance.

## What deep learning is good for?
* **Long list of rules:** When traditional rule fails, machine learning/ deep learning may help.
* **Continally changing Environment:** Deep Learning can adapt to new scenarios.
* **Discovering insights within large collection of data:** Can you imagine to write rules for how 1000's of images looks like
* **Mostly used in case of Unstructred data:** e.g. Images, Text, Audio, Video etc

## What deep learning is not good for?
* When you don't have much data
* When the traditional approach is better option
* When you need explainability

## Difference between ML & DL
Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning. A machine learning workflow starts with relevant features being manually extracted from images. The features are then used to create a model that categorizes the objects in the image. In deep learning, relevant features are automatically extracted from images.

## PyTorch
PyTorch is an open source machine learning library used for developing and training neural network based deep learning models, initially developed by Facebook’s AI research group.

Pytorch uses core Python concepts like classes, structures and conditional loops — that are a lot familiar to our eyes, hence a lot more intuitive to understand.
